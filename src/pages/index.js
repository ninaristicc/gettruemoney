    <p className="descr"><i>If you happen to be based in Southeast Asia or countries like Thailand, the Philippines, or Indonesia are your place of choice for long-stay vacations, then you might hear the term ‘TrueMoney’ spoken out loud quite often.</i> <br></br><br></br>Despite what a foreigner might think, TrueMoneyactually describes a <b>financial service</b> that has been building up steam for the last several years in the region. It may not be PayPal in terms of worldwide adoption, but it may very well be as popular as the US-based eWallet in Southeast Asia alone.<br></br><br></br>Indeed, what started as a mobile financial revolution in Thailand back in the early 2000s quickly spread to other countries in the region, in the second decade of the new millennium.<br></br><br></br> Furthermore, the Thai-based financial company keeps growing in 2019 with more customers demanding an updated English version of the eWallet. It was only natural to bring to those very customers an <b>updated TrueMoney English review</b> on the trending mobile-based Asian epayment provider. </p>

    <h2 className="ha2">What Is TrueMoney Wallet?</h2>
    <p><b>TrueMoney is an e-money service just like the granddaddy of them all, PayPal. </b><br></br><br></br>The initial company behind the service - True Corporation - was founded in 2003 in Thailand. However, the eWallet is currently controlled by Ascend Money which is part of an established conglomerate in all southeast Asia called Ascend Group. <br></br><br></br>That’s not all though. The highest valued financial technology firm and the world’s most valuable unicorn company, <a href="https://www.antfin.com/introduction.htm" target="_blank">Ant Financial</a> - formerly known as Alipay - has been investing in TrueMoney service since 2016, implementing the latest technologies to make the wallet even more secure and easy to use.<br></br><br></br>While Thailand was its starting point, TrueMoney expanded to five more countries as well: the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. That means anyone based in these states - citizens or even foreigners established temporarily or permanently in the region - can use the mobile service comfortably without having to worry about any legal implications. <br></br><br></br>The wallet is more or less adapted for all these countries and, as a result, the current customer base is over 30 million in total. As of May 2019, the total processed value reached well over $7 billion and counting. <br></br><br></br>If all these numbers haven’t convinced you, then how about this? The service won the prestigious <a href="https://asianbankerawards.com" target="_blank">‘Asian Banker Award’</a> for three straight years, plus ‘The Best Mobile Payments Service’ in 2019.</p>

    <h2 className="ha2">TrueMoney 2019: How To Apply</h2>
    <p>Before spending though, you might want to know what are the current updated TrueMoney requirements to use the service. In other words, <b>how to apply for a fully-fledged TrueMoney account.</b><br></br><br></br>Signing up and filling a form is quite easy, yet what happens after that? Due to regulations and the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) act, TrueMoney requires an <b>identity verification</b> from all users. Thai citizens, for example, must provide their ID card as a standard. To increase the limits, the Thai citizen must verify his or her identity at a 7-Eleven convenience store, with the help of the employees or at a TrueMoney kiosk. To speed up the process, it’s better to use the former method during working days & standard working hours. <br></br><br></br>Non-Thai citizens must have their passport ready in order to get through the verification process. The passport must remain valid for at least six months after you complete the verification. Also, you should have a decent HD camera for a selfie. Worth mentioning is that the user must be 15 or older in order to apply & cannot create more than one account. <br></br><br></br>You will find certain limitations if you aren’t a citizen of where your TrueMoney app is based. For example, for foreign citizens in Thailand, the wallet limit is THB 5,000 and the transaction limit is THB 5,000 per day. </p>
